<h2 id="introduction-to-websphere-automation">Introduction to WebSphere Automation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-automation"><span class="underline">IBM WebSphere Automation</span></a> is focused on delivering value into existing WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environments, helping administrators reduce the cost, effort, and risk of addressing common vulnerabilities, automating tasks, and remediating capacity incidents.</p>
<p>It removes manual toil so that your team can spend more time innovating while minimizing the cost of extending the life and maximizing the ROI of your WebSphere investments.</p>
<p>In conversations with customers, the same three concerns come up repeatedly. Organizations need to keep their IT estate secure and compliant, resilient to disruption and running optimally while reducing costs and maximizing ROI.</p>
<p>WebSphere Automation helps organizations gain visibility, operational efficiencies, and cost savings quickly by extending the life of WebSphere investments and giving teams time back to focus on unlocking new value and fixing the imbalance of pure maintenance versus innovation tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WebSphere operators and administrators save time and embrace DevSecOps by implementing patches more efficiently on virtual and container environments to keep operations compliant and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance remediation capabilities with insights and recommendations to improve the speed and depth of understanding of outages and anomalies as they occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augment the operational experience with access to simplified and consolidated information that enables teams to act.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With WebSphere Automation, security, business efficiency and resiliency become standard. IBM can meet you wherever you are in your optimization and automation journeys to help you quickly deliver value and increase ROI, all while laying a solid automation foundation to support future growth.</p>
<p>IBM WebSphere Automation is available as a stand-alone offering or as an addition to IBM Cloud Pak® for Watson AIOps. As part of IBM Automation platform, IBM WebSphere Automation includes containerized components and common software services on top of a common automation layer, to manage WebSphere’s incidents, hybrid applications, and cost with complete observability, governance, and compliance.</p>
<p>Deploy virtually anywhere through containers supported by Red Hat® OpenShift® software, on IBM Cloud®, on essentially any existing infrastructure on-premises, or through private and public clouds. Use only the capabilities you need with a fully modular approach that’s designed to be easy to consume.</p>
<h2 id="business-context">Business Context</h2>
<p>You are a WebSphere Administrator, part of a WebSphere Operations Team responsible for maintaining security compliance of the WebSphere estate in the enterprise. A typical “as-is” process for maintaining security compliance for WebSphere environments is depicted below.</p>
<p><strong>Today (as-is):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IBM sends generic “FLASH” to indicate a new WAS security bulletin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You subscribe and receive IBM Security Bulletins to be aware about vulnerabilities, its potential impact, severity, and recommended solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, WAS inventory is maintained in spreadsheets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on that, you check if this CVE applies to your managed inventory (Spreadsheet)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You determine if an APAR / Fix Pack upgrade should be applied to    existing environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You deploy the fix to the impacted environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You update the WAS inventory (Spreadsheet) and provide up-to-date    reports to audit and compliance teams</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As is, your inventory is a spreadsheet, containing all information about your servers, such as the versions of the installed servers, which operating system they're installed on, and iFixes which have been applied, etc</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image2.png" /></p>
<p>Currently, this is a very manual, time-consuming process, and you'd like to automate this process to direct valuable time and resource elsewhere. This is where <strong>IBM WebSphere Automation</strong> will help!</p>
<p>You would like to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Management dashboard:</strong> Consolidated dashboard increases awareness and response time to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated vulnerability tracking:</strong> Let WebSphere Automation track new security bulletins across your existing traditional WebSphere and Liberty environments, on virtual machines or containers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual notifications:</strong> Receive security bulletin notifications only when new vulnerabilities affect the environment you manage, reducing noise and interruptions to the WebSphere operations team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shared, live visibility to key stakeholders:</strong> WebSphere operators and security compliance teams can see the real-time security posture of the WebSphere estate, accelerating action and minimizing the risk of miscommunication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lab, you use the IBM WebSphere Automation to secure operations to reduce risk and meet compliance.</p>
<p>At the end of this lab, you will be able to connect teams with the most relevant information through a single dashboard. This enables you to discover, analyze and remediate common vulnerabilities and exposures across instances. Furthermore, this information can be exported to a CSV file to be shared amongst the broader team. </p>

<p>Application Runtimes represent the Traditional WebSphere and WebSphere Liberty servers that have been registered with IBM Automation.</p>
<p><img alt="welcome menu" src="../lab1-media/media/image14.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Application runtimes page appears. There should be no data since no WebSphere servers are registered/configured yet.</p>
<p><img alt="app runtime" src="../lab1-media/media/image15.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you start to register servers to the Dashboard, you need to configure an email to received notifications about CVEs.</p>

<p>a. Click <strong>Add email address</strong> (1)</p>
<p>b. Enter <em>your email</em> and click <strong>Save</strong> (2).</p>
<p><img alt="notification email" src="../lab1-media/media/image17.png" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Great!</strong> Your email is configured to receive security notifications.</p>
<p>In the next section, you will register servers to WebSphere Automation.</p>
<h2 id="getting-configuration-parameters">Getting configuration parameters</h2>
<p>Add each of your WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Liberty servers to WebSphere Automation by registering them with the <strong>usage metering</strong> service.</p>
<p>To register your application servers with the usage metering service in WebSphere Automation, you must configure the usage metering feature in each application server. To configure the usage metering feature in each of your application servers, you must obtain the following usage metering details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>URL</strong>: The URL of the usage metering service in WebSphere Automation. This service registers WebSphere Application Server and Liberty servers with WebSphere Automation so that you can track security vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API Key</strong>: The token used to authenticate the WebSphere Application Server and Liberty servers during the registration process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage metering certificate</strong>: The certificate that contains the public key. This key allows an application server that is registering with WebSphere Automation to do an SSL handshake with the metering service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, you will get these configuration parameters. Let’s start it!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Return to the desktop and open a new <strong>terminal</strong> window.</p>
<p><img alt="open terminal" src="../lab1-media/media/image18.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log in as <strong>root</strong> user</p>
<pre><code>su root
</code></pre>
<p>a. Enter the following password when prompted</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first character in the password is numeric One (1)</p>
<pre><code>1bm2021rhjb
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, log in to the OCP Cluster using the command below:</p>
<pre><code>oc login --username=ocadmin --password=ibmocp46 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true --server=https://api.ocp.ibm.edu:6443
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="oc login" src="../lab1-media/media/image19.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the project you are working on is <strong>websphere-automation</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>oc project websphere-automation
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>oc</strong> command to get the URL of the usage metering service in WebSphere Automation and save it to a file  “/opt/IBM/WebSphere/metering-url.txt”</p>
<pre><code>echo https://$(oc get route cpd -n websphere-automation -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/websphereauto/meteringapi &gt; /opt/IBM/WebSphere/metering-url.txt
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the contents of the saved file to ensure the URL was captured.</p>
<pre><code>cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/metering-url.txt
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image20.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the <strong>api-key</strong> that will be used to authenticate the WebSphere Application Server and Liberty servers during the registration process. Save it to a file named “/opt/IBM/WebSphere/api-key.txt”</p>
<pre><code>oc -n websphere-automation get secret automation-secure-metering-apis-encrypted-tokens -o jsonpath='{.data.automation-secure-metering-apis-sa}' | base64 -d &gt; /opt/IBM/WebSphere/api-key.txt; echo &gt;&gt; /opt/IBM/WebSphere/api-key.txt
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the contents of the saved file to ensure the api-key (token) was captured.</p>
<pre><code>cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/api-key.txt
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image21.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, get the Server certificate that is used for SSL handshake between the servers and IBM Automation, and save it to a file named “/opt/IBM/WebSphere/cacert.pem”</p>
<pre><code>oc get secret external-tls-secret -n websphere-automation -o jsonpath='{.data.cert\.crt}' | base64 -d &gt; /opt/IBM/WebSphere/cacert.pem
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the contents of the saved file to ensure the api-key (token) was captured.</p>
<pre><code>cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/cacert.pem
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image22.png" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Great!</strong> Now you have all the configuration parameters necessary to register the application servers with the usage metering service in WebSphere Automation.</p>
<p>In the next section, you register your first server in WebSphere Automation.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-liberty-server-v200012">Configuring Liberty Server v20.0.0.12</h2>
<p>In this section, you configure Liberty Server version 20.0.0.12 to register to WebSphere Automation. Since Liberty servers are easily created, you will first create a new Liberty server and start it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new Liberty server, version 20.0.0.12, using the command below:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/bin/server create Liberty_200012_server
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="2012 server created" src="../lab1-media/media/image23.png" />
<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you need to configure the server to use TLS/SSL using the provided server_tls.xml file:</p>
<pre><code>cp -f /home/ibmuser/Desktop/lab_backup/liberty200012/server_tls.xml /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/server.xml
</code></pre>
<p>a. If promted to overwite the file, enter "<strong>y</strong>" for yes.
<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the Liberty server:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/bin/server start Liberty_200012_server
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="starting server 200012" src="../lab1-media/media/image24.png" />
  <br>
  4.  Now, you need to update the DefaultKeyStore with the server certificate to trust the server for https connection:</p>
<p>The command below will import the “<strong>cacert.pem</strong>” file, that you saved in a previous step, into the Liberty trust store, thereby trusting the server for secure HTTPS connections from IBM Automation.</p>
<pre><code>keytool -import -trustcacerts -file /opt/IBM/WebSphere/cacert.pem -keystore /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/resources/security/key.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -storepass th1nkpassword -noprompt
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="certificate store" src="../lab1-media/media/image25.png" />
<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the usage metering in the new server. This is configured in the Liberty <strong>server.xml</strong> file.</p>
<p>a. Open the server.xml file using the “gedit” editor</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/server.xml
</code></pre>
<p>b.  Add the <strong>usageMetering-1.0</strong> feature to the existing features in the &lt;featureManager> element, as illustrated below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;feature&gt;usageMetering-1.0&lt;/feature&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image26.png" />
<br></p>
<p>c.  In the server.xml file, add the <strong>usageMetering</strong> element below:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;usageMetering url="${metering-url}" apiKey="${api-key}" sslRef="defaultSSL"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="usage metering 200012" src="./lab1-media/media/image27-a.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> the server.xml file.</p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a <strong>bootstrap.properties</strong> file for the Liberty server that contains the variable values for  <strong>metering_url</strong> and <strong>api_key</strong> that are defined in the server.xml file</p>
<pre><code>echo "metering-url=$(cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/metering-url.txt)" &gt;&gt; /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/bootstrap.properties

echo "api-key=$(cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/api-key.txt)" &gt;&gt; /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/bootstrap.properties
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>cat</strong> command to view the contents of the <strong>bootstrap.properties</strong> file to ensure it has proper values assigned to the variables</p>
<pre><code>cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/bootstrap.properties
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>metering-url</strong> and <strong>api-key</strong> variables should have values as illustrated below. </p>
<p><img alt="bootstrap properties" src="./lab1-media/media/image29-a.png" /></p>
<p><br> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart the Liberty server so that it can be initialized with the bootstrap.properties file. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use the <strong>--clean</strong> option when starting the Liberty server, to clear any cached data. </p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/bin/server stop Liberty_200012_server

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/bin/server start Liberty_200012_server --clean
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the Liberty server “<strong>messages.log</strong>” file and find the message indicating that the server was registered to the metering service.  </p>
<pre><code>tail /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty200012/usr/servers/Liberty_200012_server/logs/messages.log
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="registered with metering service" src="./lab1-media/media/image29-b.png" /></p>
<p><br> </p>
</li>

<h2 id="configuring-liberty-server-v20009">Configuring Liberty Server v20.0.0.9</h2>
<p>In this section, you configure another Liberty Server to your WebSphere Automation dashboard. The process is the same (using the usage metering service in WebSphere Automation). However, to simplify the lab, we have pre-created the configuration files to make the configuration simpler.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Return to the Terminal window where you are logged in as “<strong>root</strong>”.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can run the “<strong>whoami</strong>” command in the terminal window to determine the currently logged in user.</p>
<p><br> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, you need to create the Liberty server version 20.0.0.9, using the command below:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/bin/server create Liberty_20009_server
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since you have already configured <strong>usageMetering</strong> feature for Liberty version 20.0.0.12, we have a provided couple of server.xml files to make the configuration simpler.</p>
<p>a.  Copy the <strong>tls configuration</strong> that we provided, to the new Liberty server configuration.</p>
<pre><code>cp -f /home/ibmuser/Desktop/lab_backup/liberty20009/server_tls.xml /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/usr/servers/Liberty_20009_server/server.xml

<p>a. If promted to overwite the file, enter"<strong>y</strong>" for yes.</p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to the WebSphere Automation dashboard, confirm that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Liberty server is registered.</p>
<p><img alt="dashboard server2" src="../lab1-media/media/image33.png" /></p>
<p>The dashboard shows that this server is vulnerable for some CVEs</p>

<p>In this section, you configure a traditional WebSphere Application
Server to your WebSphere Automation dashboard. With traditional
WebSphere, you use the wsadmin script to configure the usage metering
service.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, let’s start the traditional WebSphere (tWAS) 9.0.5.6 server. Return to the terminal window and execute the command below:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9056/bin/startServer.sh tWAS_9056_server

<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image37.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure usage-metering using the wsadmin script below:</p>
<p>The wsadmin command invokes a Python script named configuretWasUsageMetering.py. The script requires the same <strong>url</strong> and <strong>apiKey</strong> that you gathered earlier from the IBM automation environment. These parameters are captured from the text files that you saved earlier in the lab and inserted into the url and apiKey parameters.</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9056/bin/wsadmin.sh -f /api-usagemetering/scripts/configuretWasUsageMetering.py url=$(cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/metering-url.txt) apiKey=$(cat /opt/IBM/WebSphere/api-key.txt) trustStorePassword=th1nkpassword
</code></pre>
<p>The script should run successfully as illustrated below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image38.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Great, you first traditional WAS server is configured. Let’s check the WebSphere Automation dashboard. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go back to the browser, navigate to the <strong>Servers</strong> dashboard, and confirm that the tWAS v9.0.5.6 server was registered.</p>
<p><img alt="dashboard tWAS1" src="../lab1-media/media/image39.png" /></p>

<h2 id="update-liberty-server-v20009-to-fix-the-vulnerability">Update Liberty server v20.0.0.9 to fix the vulnerability</h2>
<p>In this section, you will fix one vulnerability in our Liberty Server
v20.0.0.9 using two different approaches. First, you fix by only
updating the configuration. Later, you apply an iFix to solve the
vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="updating-configurations">Updating configurations</h3>
<p>Liberty 20.0.0.9 is impacted by CVE-2020-10693. This is because it
configures the <strong>beanValidation-2.0</strong> feature. See
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6348216"><span class="underline">CVE-2020-10693</span></a>
for more info.</p>
<p>We should resolve this by applying the iFix <strong>PH29942</strong> as documented in
the CVE-2020-10693. However, for the lab, we can also do a quick test by
unconfiguring this feature, to illustrate that IBM Automation does
interrogate the Liberty Server configuration, to determine if a Liberty
server is impacted by a CVE that is the result of a specific
configuration feature. This is valuable because IBM Automation can
pinpoint specific servers that are impacted not ONLY based on the
version of server, but also the specific configuration that is impacted
by the CVE.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Edit the server.xml, using the command below:</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/usr/servers/Liberty_20009_server/server.xml
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment out the <strong>beanValidation-2.0</strong> feature:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- &lt;feature&gt;beanValidation-2.0&lt;/feature&gt; --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image43.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save</strong> and <strong>close</strong> the <em>server.xml</em> file.</p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to your browser, check that the Liberty 20.0.0.9 server does <strong>NOT</strong> show the <strong>CVE-2020-10693</strong> vulnerability. The update is picked up automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="no CVE 2020 10693" src="../lab1-media/media/image44.png" /></p>
<p>Great, you removed the vulnerability by updating the configuration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="resolve-the-issue-by-applying-an-ifix">Resolve the issue By Applying an iFix</h3>
<p>However, instead of removing the beanValidationFeature-2.0, the correct
process is to apply the appropriate iFix to get rid of the
vulnerability.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, add back the beanValidation feature:</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/usr/servers/Liberty_20009_server/server.xml
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncomment the <strong>beanValidation-2.0</strong> feature:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;feature&gt;beanValidation-2.0&lt;/feature&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../lab1-media/media/image45.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Close</strong> the server.xml file.</p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to the browser, make sure the vulnerability shows up again.</p>
<p><img alt="cve back" src="../lab1-media/media/image46.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to <strong>stop</strong> the server before the iFix can be applied. Return to the terminal window and run the command below to stop the Liberty2009 server.</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/bin/server stop Liberty_20009_server
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, apply the iFix, by running the following command.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We have already downloaded the iFixes used for this lab. They are stored in <strong>/iFix</strong> directory on the <strong>STUDENT</strong> VM.</p>
<pre><code>/iFix/PH29942/imcl_ifix_install.sh 20009
</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p><img alt="apply fix" src="../lab1-media/media/image47.png" /></p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great, the iFix was applied. Now, start the server again:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/Liberty20009/bin/server start Liberty_20009_server
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to the <strong>WebSphere Automation Dashboard.</strong> You should notice that the <strong>CVE-2020-10693</strong> was removed from the Liberty_20009_server.</p>
<p><img alt="no CVE 2020 10693" src="../lab1-media/media/image44.png" /></p>

</ol>
<h2 id="update-twas-server-v9057-to-fix-the-vulnerability">Update tWAS server v9.0.5.7 to fix the vulnerability</h2>
<p>In this section, you will apply an iFix to the traditional WebSphere
9.0.5.7 server to remove the <strong>CVE-2021-26296</strong> vulnerability.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notice in the IBM Automation console that tWAS 9.0.5.7 is vulnerable to CVE-2021-26296.</p>
<p><img alt="CVE 2021 26296" src="../lab1-media/media/image48.png" /></p>
<p>Now, you will fix it by applying the appropriate iFix.</p>
<p><br>     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, stop the server, wait until it has stopped:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer9057/bin/stopServer.sh tWAS_9057_server
